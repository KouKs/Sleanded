                    Sleanded is a brand-new coding company formed by 
                    flexible and creative students who love what they are doing and are good at it.

                    One chilly winter evening, two friends have decided they’d wanted a change
                    in their boring lives. So they quit playing Minecraft and got somehow
                    excited about making websites. They started off slowly - learnt basic <span class="red-text">HTML</span> and <span class="red-text">CSS</span>.
                    However, as time passed by, they wanted to make their websites more interactive
                    and add some responsivity, too. That is when they met <span class="red-text">php</span> and <span class="red-text">jQuery</span>.
                    Those days, they were no more than fourteen-year-old innocent yordles. 
                </p>
                <p class="big justify margin indent dark-grey-text">
                    They went beyond creating websites, those handy students also
                    learnt how to create desktop and browser applications in <span class="red-text">Java</span> or <span class="red-text">C++</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="big justify margin indent dark-grey-text">
                    Nowadays, they have mastered many techniques of creating stunning websites,
                    useful apps and user-friendly interfaces.
